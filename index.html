<P><b>Basic Concepts of the web</b></P>
<p>There are three componets in the web that work together.
  <br> The first is your computer and its web browser.
  <br> The second is the internet itself which is a collection of documents and files.
  <br> The third is the web servers that store the documents that make up the web.
  <br> HTTP is the protocol which allows the three separate parts to communicate with eachother.</p>
<p><b>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</b></p>
<p>HTML is the format in which the majority of documents that make up the web are made in.
  <br>
  <b>HTML is made up of five parts</b>.
  <br> Text Content - what you see
  <br> Markup - what it looks like
  <br> References to other documents (e.g. images and videos)
  <br> links to other pages</p>
<p><b>Elements and HTML Tags</b></p>
<p>An Element is a piece of the web page e.g text, picture, video that is defined by an HTML tag. HTML tags are commands that tell the computer how to interpret the document that do not show up when you are looking at the document on the web. There are two
  basic types of tags one with an opening tag then contents then another tag that tells the computer when that command ends. The other type of tag is a void tag. This is a tag that does not have a closing tag. A couple of examples of void tags are the
  line break tag and a picture tag.

Here is a video</a> that gives a good explanation of tags</p>
<p><b>Inline Vs. Block Elements</b></p>
<p>Inline elements are inserted inline with the text and code. Block elements are inserted in a defined box area with height and width dimensions. These dimensions can be changed controlling the size of the elements.</p>
